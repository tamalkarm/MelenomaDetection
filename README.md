## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- This is part of upgrad assesment, where its requireed to build a multiclass classification model using CNN in Tensorflow. This model is designed to detect 9 types of different cancers including melenoma.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and othe diseases. The images are provided by ISIC. All images are intially sorted as per the skin condition.

## Conclusions
- IAgumentation overcomes the problem of overfitting 
- Solving the class imbalance problem removes the underfititng
